## Overview 
For this project, I practiced my web design skills by editing HTML elements and their styles. With the HTML and CSS already provided, I was asked to add, edit, and remove the pre-existing code and make it my own. Part of the project was to also add additional pages and images on your own for meeting the exceeds criteria.  This gave me a good first look on working with HTML and CSS.

## Skills
- HTML
- CSS

## Conclusion
At the end of this project, I had a better understanding of HTML and CSS. Going for the exceeds really helped me grasp these new concepts. This project also gave me a web page that I can use as a personal online portfolio to advertise my experience, skills, and goals. It could also be used to share my social media links!
